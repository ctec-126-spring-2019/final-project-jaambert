Final Project Proposal
5/29/2019

Final Project:
I will take my previous created pints across america website and inject jquery and the new concepts that I have learned into a finalized website to run along side my other social medias for said name.   

Ideas I would like to inject:
- Professional looking jquery forms page with applicable changes for the services I am actually going to offer with error bucket.
- A cycling beer of the day or week that will change with my page with a picture and tasting notes from said beer.
- Add brewery of the month section with cycling pictures/notes for the page
- Use new css skills to make the page look better.
- Incorporate google map for local brewery locations(I dont know if I know how to do this correctly yet but I would like to attempt to create a area reference for breweries close by, where you can locate where you are and have walking distance bars pop up.)
- Upcoming events 
- Twitter/instagram ticker update on page of what I have posted with links to follow said accounts.
